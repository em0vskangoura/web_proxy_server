# web_proxy_server
A 2-day simple web proxy server

* Feel free to clone this source code and modify it for any purposes
* Feel free to improve it because I am pretty positive that it has some bugs and lots of space for improvement.

Its purpose is to demonstrate in a simple way how a proxy server works.

Compilation & execution:

- Use the command "make" to compile the binaries.
- Run the web server: server -p <server_port>
- Run the client: client -s <server_IP> <server_port>
